# stock-trader-app
A small application I built to allow a user to be able to buy and sell virtual stocks. The project is buit with Vue.js, Webpack, Vuetify, Express and uses material design techniques. 

## Motivation
I wanted to build this application to get an intro to state management systems in Vue.js. I hope to be able to improve this project as time goes on, so that I can incorporate a database and Axios support for vue which will allow live tickers for the application.
